# Boilerplate Directory

A simple Next.js website that serves as a directory for various boilerplate projects. This project aims to help developers find and discover useful boilerplate templates for their development needs.

## Overview

This is a lightweight web application built with Next.js that displays a curated list of boilerplate projects. The project is intentionally kept simple and straightforward, focusing on ease of use and quick access to boilerplate information.

## Current Implementation

- Built with Next.js for optimal performance and developer experience
- Uses static JSON file for data storage (no database required)
- Simple and clean user interface
- Easy to maintain and update content

## Project Structure

```
├── app/                    # Next.js app directory
├── components/            # Reusable React components
├── data/                  # Static JSON data storage
└── public/               # Static assets
```

## Getting Started
